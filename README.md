# constraint-zine

Just a goofy little project for the [School for Poetic Computation's Code Words course](http://sfpc.io/codewords/) ([Sunday class](https://www.gjtorikian.com/posts/2018/08/17/code-words-at-sfpc/#sunday)).

It's a bit more emo than I would've liked.

Uses [this template](http://blog.umamidesign.com/ud-content/2013/09/ud_130918_zine-instructions.jpg) to print it.
